## Welcome to Naveen's Universe

## Categories

I consider the following categories for every movie/show I rate:
- Plotline
- Acting
- Cinematography (Video/Photo)
- Sound (Music/Effects)
- Screenplay (Script)
- Visual Effects (Editing)

All categories are rated on a scale of 1 to 10, and "Naveen's Rating"
is the average of all these. If you would like to create your own rating
based on mine, please use [this sheet]() to adjust the categories based on
your personal preference. Provide a 5 in the column if you care about that
category a lot and a 0 if you don't care about it at all. Enjoy!
